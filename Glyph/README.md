**Glyph** is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression.
Instead of extending token-based context windows, Glyph renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision–language models (VLMs).
This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.

(Upper) Comparison of two paradigms for long-context tasks: conventional approaches directly feeding plain text into LLMs, and the proposed VLM-based paradigm, Glyph, which renders text as compact images to achieve substantial input-token compression. (Lower) Glyph attains competitive performance on LongBench and MRCR, while offering significant compression and inference speedup over its text backbone model on 128K-token inputs.

## Demo
We provide a ready-to-run demo script that deploys both a baseline text model (Qwen3/GLM4 etc.) and **Glyph**, enabling comparison of long-context inference efficiency.

After downloading the model, to see a side-by-side comparison of the output from Qwen3 and Glyph, run:
```bash
cd demo
bash run_demo_compared.sh
```

This demo will:

* Start a text-only LLM
* Start **Glyph** with visual–text compression
* Provide a simple testing interface for long-context question answering

If you wish to view only the output from Glyph, run the following command in the demo directory:
```bash
bash run_demo.sh
```

🎬 A short demonstration is provided below, showing the faster prefill speed of Glyph on long-context inputs:

Glyph achieves notably improved prefill efficiency on long-context inputs, with increasing benefits as the sequence length grows. 🚀


## Model
Our model is built on `GLM-4.1V-9B-Base`. The fine-tuned model is publicly available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/Glyph/). 
Welcome to download and use it!

The continual pre-training data of Glyph will be added to the new version of GLM-4.1V-9B-Base and will be released later.

## Quick Start

### Setup
First, please install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
apt-get install poppler-utils
pip install transformers==4.57.1 
# Optional
pip install vllm==0.10.2 sglang==0.5.2
```
Then, run the following code:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText
import torch

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thu-coai/Glyph/main/assets/Little_Red_Riding_Hood.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Who pretended to be Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother"
            }
        ],
    }
]
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("zai-org/Glyph")
model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="zai-org/Glyph",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=8192)
output_text = processor.decode(generated_ids[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=False)
print(output_text)
```

### Rendering Config
We provide the post-training configurations for both English and Chinese in the `config` directory, along with the corresponding fonts.

You can customize the newline behavior using the `newline-markup` option in the config file, which could affect the compression ratio:
-   Set `"newline-markup": "<font color=\"#FF0000\"> \\n </font>"` to use a special visual marker for newlines.
-   Set `"newline-markup": "<br/>"` for standard line breaks.

The compression ratio is also influenced by the DPI setting:
-   **DPI=72**: Achieving an average compression of 3-4x, which is the best trade-off between compression ratio and performance.
-   **DPI=96**: Achieving an average compression of 2-3x, which usually leads to better results than dpi 72.

A rendering example:

### Image Rendering
We provide scripts to render long text into images for your convenience.

This is a simple example of rendering a single text file (e.g., input.txt) into a sequence of images. You can adjust the rendering style by modifying `CONFIG_EN_PATH`.
```python
from test_word2png_function_fast import text_to_images

CONFIG_EN_PATH = '../config/config_en.json'
OUTPUT_DIR = './output_images'
INPUT_FILE = './input.txt'

# Read text from file
with open(INPUT_FILE, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Convert text to images
images = text_to_images(
    text=text,
    output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR,
    config_path=CONFIG_EN_PATH,
    unique_id='test_001'
)

print(f"\nGenerated {len(images)} image(s):")
for img_path in images:
    print(f"  {img_path}")
```

**Note:** The current text rendering feature is implemented using the `reportlab` library. While the overall process is stable, there is still significant room for acceleration.

## Model Deployment (vLLM Acceleration)

Our model supports vLLM acceleration for inference, which significantly improves throughput and response speed in long-context scenarios. Use the following command to start the vLLM-served model:

```bash
vllm serve YOUR_MODEL_PATH --port 5002 --served-model-name glyph --allowed-local-media-path / --media-io-kwargs '{"video": {"num_frames": -1}}'
```

### Model Inference
After rendering the text into images, you can perform inference with the VLM.

```python
from vlm_inference import vlm_inference

response = vlm_inference(
    question="Based on the story in the figures, what is the ending of the wolf?",
    image_paths=["./output_images/Little_Red_Riding_Hood/page_001.png"]
)
print("VLM's Response:")
print(response)
```

## Evaluation

We provide evaluation scripts and test cases for benchmarks including LONGBENCH, MRCR, and RULER. For detailed instructions on running the evaluations, please refer to the guide in [evaluation/readme.md](./evaluation/readme.md).

## Result

### Visual-Text Compression.
![Introduction Image](assets/acc_length.png)
Glyph achieves context window scaling, matching the performance of text LLMs that use 3×–4× longer contexts through visual–text compression.

### Speedup ratios of Glyph
![Introduction Image](assets/speedup_panels_times.png)
Speedup ratios of Glyph over the text backbone model for prefill, decoding, and training across different sequence lengths.

## Known Limitations
- Sensitivity to rendering parameters: Glyph’s performance can vary with rendering settings such as resolution, font, and spacing. Since our search procedure adopts a fixed rendering configuration during post-training, the model may not generalize well to unseen or substantially different rendering styles.
- OCR-related challenges: Recognizing fine-grained or rare alphanumeric strings (e.g., UUIDs) remains difficult for visual-language models, especially with ultra-long inputs, sometimes leading to minor character misclassification.
- Limited generalization: The training of Glyph mainly targets long-context understanding, and its capability on broader tasks is yet to be studied.
